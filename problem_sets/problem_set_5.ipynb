    "Suppose that you own a mobile app that has a \"freemium\" pricing policy, and you want to model how the behavior of your users depends on the monthly subscription price that you charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population of your potential app users are distributed between three states; Non-users, Free users, and Premium users. **All users begin as Non-users**; a Non-user will never go directly from being a Non-user to being a Premium user, without first trying the app out as a Free user for at least one month. In each month, 5\\% of the Non-users will decide to try the app in the next month.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every time period, 0.5\\% of the Free users tend to leave the app and become Non-users again. After those users switch, some of the remaining users will choose to subscribe to the app in a given month (and transfer from the Free user category to the Premium user category). The probability that a Free user who did not already leave the app chooses to subscribe for the next month depends on the monthly price that you charge. If the monthly price is represented by a positive number $p$, then the probability of subscribing is given by $$\\mathbb{P}\\left[ \\text{Free user chooses to subscribe to Premium}\\right] = \\frac{1-\\mathbb{P}[\\text{Free user chooses to leave the app}]}{(1+p)^2}.$$\n",

On each subplot, show the evolution of your distribution of users over the first year of your new app. Each figure should have time $t$ as the x-axis, and the y-axis should track the proportions of users in each category, for a specific price. On these axes, show how the number of users in each category changes over time with a monthly price equal to $p=0.10$, $p=2$, and $p=20$, respectively.

Define a function `profit` that takes as arguments $p$, $c$, $T$, and a discount factor $beta$, and outputs the total discounted profit that you will earn after $t$ months.
