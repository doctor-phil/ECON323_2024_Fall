### ECON 323 – Problem Set Requirements
## Introduction
In this class, you will be submitting jupyter notebooks as your solutions to the
problem sets. Since many of you have not previously submitted code for a class,
we will discuss requirements for your submissions. While these submission rules
seem strict, standardization is a very useful habit to develop when coding and
working with data. This is especially true when you’re collaborating with other
people. We will deduct marks if these rules are not followed.
## Working Together
**You are encouraged to work on the problem sets in groups of two**, but you can
work alone if you choose. Group members should work on the problems together or work
on them individually and discuss after the fact. **The final submission should list
both group members at the top, followed by a line outlining the contribution
of each individual member to the final product.** Groups should not split the
problems up so that each person is responsible for only a portion of the questions.
We obviously cannot monitor this, but doing only half of each problem set will
be detrimental to your learning. Since you cannot rely on your group during the
exams or at a future job, you have many incentives to learn all of the material.
Even if you’re submitting the exact same code, both students must submit the
assignment on canvas.
## Only Submit Your Own Work
All of the code that you submit should be written by members of your group.
You can do some copying and pasting from the course materials when relevant,
but you are cheating yourself and your classmates if you copy code from other
sources. That being said, don’t be paranoid. Sometimes, very simple code
written by two different people is going to look similar. Just do honest work
and you have nothing to worry about.
## Address Every Aspect of the Problem
Read each question carefully and make sure you sufficiently address everything
being asked. Some things that you will need to address might not be asked as
a question. In the past, students have lost many points simply because they
did not address all aspects of a problem. If you read the problem fully and use
some common sense, what is expected will be clear. If it is not, ask the TA or
Professor.
## How to Answer Questions
When we explicitly ask a question or for a piece of information that requires
words, formulate your response in a markdown cell. Do not answer it as a
comment in your code, with a print statement, etc. Markdown cells exist for a
reason. If the question asks simply for a number or a certain result that you
obtained via your code, make sure the number is displayed when the code is
executed. The easiest way to do this is with the print() function.
## Jupyter Notebook Title
The title of your jupyter notebook for a given submission should reflect the surnames of those who worked on the notebook and the problem set being answered.
For instance, if Jane Doe and and Juan Perez solve problem set 2 together, their
jupyter notebook should be titled something similar to ”Doe Perez PS2.ipynb”
## Notebook Organization
Make sure your notebook is organized by question in the order the questions
are asked. Ideally, use markdown cells to delineate where the answer to each
question begins. This is not strictly necessary, but some degree of organization
and legibility is.
## Submit an Executed Jupyter Notebooks
You must submit an executed jupyter notebook. This means all of the cells in
the notebook have been run before saving the notebook. Assuming your code
works, you can accomplish this by pressing run all and saving after your code
has completed. An executed Jupyter notebook will display the output of the
code below the cell containing the code. We will grade as if cells that have not
been executed do not exist.
