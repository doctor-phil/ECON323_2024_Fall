# Final Project
## Dates
* Final project **proposal** is **due** on TBA
  * The writeup for this **proposal** can be very short (e.g. 1/2 page), just so we can all agree on whether it is acceptable.  **It will not be graded.**  If we think that the proposal is inappropriate, or want some clarifications, we will tell you.
  * Since the proposal is not graded, you can turn it in early if you want to get a head start on the project, and this is encouraged.
  * If you decide to work in pairs, then you should say something about how work will be divided and coordinated in the project proposal.
* The tentative final project deadline is **two weeks before the first day of finals week.** You will be allowed to make changes until the day of the final exam. A final deadline will be announced when the exam is scheduled.

## Requirements
We will accept a wide range of proposals on many different topics.  The key requirements are that:
* Something that involves data and visualization
* Practice of coding skills with Python (or another language if appropriate and approved by us)
* If you can relate this to an Honours thesis/ECON490/etc. that is great. But you cannot simply submit your thesis to us. For example, you could take your thesis and do a nice visualization notebook to go with it.
* You may work in a group of **up to four (4)** students. If you would like to work alone, you need to get my permission first.
* A common and acceptable reason to work alone is to work on something that is closely related to your thesis (see above)

## Size of Project and Grading Criteria
You should target roughly a similar length as the amount of code in one of your later problem sets (e.g. 3-5 "pages" of Jupyter notebooks).  But having a large notebook is not needed if you are doing something interesting, as you will not be graded solely on the quantity of code.

If you are basing your project on an existing thesis/etc. then we will expect a higher quality of project since you would have a good starting point.

There is no maximum limit to the length of notebooks, but you will not be awarded or penalized for a long notebook.

## Grading

There are many ways to do well on this project, for example, you could do well with alternative strategies:
* If you build a new dataset, it could compensate for less interesting analysis and visualization
* If you do a highly interactive visualization, it could compensate for using a preexisting dataset
* If you use some of the new machine learning techniques you learned in the class, you can get by with less interesting datasets

Some additional tips:
* Get an idea of your research question, or at least the general area you are interested in studying, **before** you go looking for a dataset. Feel free to run it by me after class or in office hours if you're unsure!
* Working alone can put you at a substantial disadvantage, just in terms of the amount of work that you are able to get done compared to a group of 4. I will try to take this into consideration when grading, but you will sill generally be better off working in a group.
* The ideal project should have an introduction that explains the research question in detail, followed by an analysis section, and a conclusions section that explains how you have used the analysis to answer your research question.
* Get started *early*!

The main criteria for grading will be:
* **Originality** and/or **innovativeness** of the idea
* Use of well-grounded programming techniques, either those learned in the course or that go above and beyond the course material
* Clear communication of a lesson/message from the data, both in text and visualization
* Clarity and quality of the code, and readable text that explains each step
