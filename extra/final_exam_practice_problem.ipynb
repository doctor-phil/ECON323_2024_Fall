    "#### Question 1\n",
    "In this question, we will create a function to generate linear data step-by-step. \n",
    "1. Define a function called `gen_lin_data` that takes as its input an integer `n`, and returns a matrix `X` and a vector `Y`. \n",
    "2. First we will generate `X`. Within the function,\n",
    " - Create two random (numpy) vectors of size `n` named `X_1` and `X_2` where \n",
    "    - Each element of `X_1` is independent and distributed according to the Uniform(-2,2) distribution\n",
    "    - Each element `X_2` is independent and distributed according to the Normal(2,2) distribution. \n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Finally, concatenate `X_1` and `X_2` to generate `X` so that `X` is a numpy object with `n` rows and 2 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now we will work towards generating `Y`. Within the function,\n",
    "  - Define a numpy array called `beta` and set it equal to `[-1,2]`. \n",
    "  - Define another `n` dimensional vector called `eps` where each element is independent and distributed according to the Normal(0,1/2) distribution. \n",
    "  - Finally, Generate a vector of size `n` called `Y` according to the following equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = X \\cdot \\beta + eps\n",
    "$$\n",
    "4. Now that your function is defined, test your function in the designated cell and call it with **`n` equal to 500**. Save the resulting arrays as `Y500` and `X500`. **Print** the average of `Y500`."

    "#### Question 2\n",
    "In this question, we will create our own function to perform basic OLS estimation.\n",
    "1. Define a function called `simple_OLS` that takes a vector `Y` and a matrix `X` as inputs and returns a vector of OLS (linear regression) coefficient estimates. **To get full marks, you must explicitly calculate the OLS coefficients using the analytical formula for linear regression.** You will get some partial credit for estimating the equations using another method.\n",
    "2. **In the Markdown Cell below your function**, answer this question: If `y` is an $n$-vector and `X` is an $n\\times d$ matrix, what are the dimensions of the objects that will be output by the `simple_OLS` function? Verify this with your code or justify it using linear algebra.\n",
    "3. In the designated cell, define `beta_hat` to be the output of `simple_OLS` using `Y500` and `X500` from the previous problem.\n",
    "4. In the second provided Markdown Cell, explain what values you would expect the entries of `beta_hat` to be close to, and why.\n"

    "#### Question 3\n",

    "1. Define a function called `simple_eval` that takes `X`, `Y`, and `beta_hat` as inputs and returns `est_mse`, the mean-squared error of `beta_hat`. \n",
    "2. Within that function\n",
    "    - Define `Yhat` to be the predicted values of `beta_hat` appled to `X`. \n",
    "    - Calculate the mean-squared error and set it to `est_mse`. To do this, you can either use the metrics module from scikitlearn or calculate the mean-squared error by hand. \n",
