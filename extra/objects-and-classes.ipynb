    "An object in Python is just like an object in real life; it's something that can represent a person, a thing, or a more abstract concept in the digital world; a data structure. Think of an object as almost like a physical item, something tangible that has some features, and some instructions that help you use or interact with in a specific way. For example, a car, a consumer, or a firm can all be considered objects. Similarly, all of the data structures that we have worked with so far (integers, strings, lists, etc.) are objects."

    "Objects are useful in programming for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modularity and reusability**: Objects allow you to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Each object encapsulates its own data and behavior, which means that you can focus on developing and testing individual objects independently. This **modularity** makes the overall codebase easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, objects can be **reused** in different parts of a program or in different programs altogether, saving time and effort. By grouping related data and behavior in a modular way, it becomes easier to locate and modify specific functionalities. This modular organization makes the codebase more maintainable, as changes made to one object or class can be made in a way that has minimal impact on other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Objects help in abstracting away unnecessary details and focusing on the essential aspects of a problem. For example, by creating objects that represent real-world entities, you can model complex systems with many interacting parts in a more intuitive and meaningful way. This **abstraction** simplifies the overall code structure and makes it easier to understand and reason about.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Collaboration and teamwork**: Object-oriented programming encourages collaboration among developers. By defining objects and classes with well-defined interfaces, multiple developers can work on different parts of a program simultaneously, as long as they adhere to the agreed-upon rules. This collaborative approach improves productivity, enables parallel development, and fosters code reusability across team members."

    "### Defining a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "When making your own objects, the first thing you want to do is define a **class**. A class is like a template or a map of the object, that tells you what information it stores and gives you some rules for how you can interact with it. When you take a class and instantiate it (define a new variable according to the rules of your class), that instantiation is called an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many classes (like `string` and `float`) come bundled in Python by default. Other times, it can be useful to define your own custom classes, so that you can define helpful objects later on.\n",

That is, a first outer loop searches over prices, and within each price, there are two other loops that run at each iteration to find the amount demanded and supplied. Since Python loops can get pretty slow, this is definitely not the fastest way to solve this problem. However, it should give you some intuition about why these objects can be so useful. Throughout the class, we will discuss a number of ways that this code could be sped up.\n",

In this case, the model could have been solved analytically by simply taking supply equal to demand and solving for the market clearing price. However, now that we have a basic structure of the problem encoded into objects, we could make the problem a lot more complicated if we wanted, and our `Economy` object will still give us a simple way to find the solution. This type of simulation, one that uses local local heuristic to simulate the behavior of hypothetical agents, is called an **agent-based model**."

    "### Programming Paradigms (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all programming languages use objects. The paradigm of using objects to make your code more modular is called **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It's worth noting that many languages support OOP, but it is not universal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of a few popular programming paradigms and the languages that are built around them:\n",
    "1. **Procedural programming** (C, FORTRAN): a branch of imperative programming that attempts to make code modular by focusing directly on the sequences of steps needed to solve a problem. It emphasizes procedures, functions, and subroutines. In this paradigm, programs are organized into procedures that contain a series of instructions. Data is often shared globally, and functions manipulate this shared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object-oriented programming** (C++, Java): organizes procedural programs around objects that encapsulate collections of data with their behavior to increase modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functional programming** (Haskell, Lisp): emphasizes computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It focuses on immutability, higher-order and nested functions. Unlike prodedural paradigm, functional programming attempts to avoid relying on global variables or a shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generic programming** (Julia): focuses on creating reusable and type-independent code that can work with different data types. It allows for the creation of generic algorithms and data structures that can operate on multiple types without the need for explicit specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This list is far from exhaustive. There are many other programming paradigms that can each give you useful ways to structure certain problems. These range from extremely general purpose paradigms like **declarative programming** (e.g. Mathematica), which constrasts to imperative and procedural programming by focusing on the declaration of the problem rather than the procedure of its solution, to highly specialized paradigms like **logical programming** (e.g. Prolog) that are designed to replicate natural language and formal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any problem that you can solve with one of these languages can be solved in any of the other languages (in other words, these languages are all **Turing complete**). However, different paradigms are well-suited to different problems, and some programs that are fast and easy to write in one paradigm might be extremely tedious to write in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many languages (like Python and R) are not designed to work only within the constraints of one paradigm. This is a huge benefit to these languages. Indeed, they are specially designed to support multiple paradigms that include at least procedural, functional, and object-oriented. This is one feature that makes these languages highly versatile and useful for many types of problems."
